\subsection{Classes}

Like \cite{qadir2011classifying}, we make the distinction between expository text (\textbf{expository}) and speech act carrying text (\textbf{speech act}). The former present factual information while the latter contain conversational units bearing communicative acts between the writer and its readers. These two constitute the first two classes of the five top-level classes of our taxonomy. The third is structural information (\textbf{structure}), which will represent all the information - redacted or automatic - included to facilitate the understanding of the message or the conversation. These three classes correspond to a message's body, its \todo{DÃ©finir "important"} important content. We sort other content - such as quoted text, automatic signatures, privacy statements etc. - in the last two classes: quoted text (\textbf{quote}) and boilerplate content (\textbf{boilerplate}). These two categories' content's definitions are based on the work of \cite{lampert2009segmenting}.

The \textbf{speech act} superclass contains three main subclasses: \textbf{commissives}, \textbf{directives} and \textbf{expressives}. They are derived from the five classes defined in \cite{searle1976taxonomy} (the fourth class, "representatives", was removed because making the distinction between sentences expressing the belief or a judgment of truth and expository sentences was not very useful to us, and the fifth class, "declarations", was omitted because we assume it will almost never appear in our corpus: \cite{qadir2011classifying} found almost no example of it in their datasets).

All these classes themselves contain a multitude of labels, all of which will be presented details in the following subsections of this document. We postulate that a sentence can carry several labels.

The following labels have been empirically extracted from our corpus. This was done by two researchers through the analysis of individual messages, on a sentence by sentence basis.

\subsubsection{Boilerplate}

Boilerplate text is non-content text found around the message's body, typically reused without modification across multiple messages.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Signature: the message author's identity
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Automatic signature: signature automatically appended to the message (e.g. \textit{"Brian Lunergan Nepean, Ontario Canada"})
			\item Manual: signature written by the author for this specific message (e.g. \textit{"Sean"})
		\end{itemize}
	\item Advertisement: advertising material automatically appended to the message (e.g. \textit{"Novo Yahoo!"})
	\item Disclaimer: legal disclaimers and privacy statements automatically appended to the message
	\item Contact: the author's contact information (e.g. \textit{"mns:renato4010591@hotmail.com"})
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quote}

Quoted text include both content quoted in reply to previous messages in the same conversation thread and forwarded content from other conversations.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Replied text: content quoted from a previous message in the thread
	\item Forwarded text: content from a message outside the current conversation that has been forwarded by the current message (email only)
	\item Quote: quote from an outside source, such as a monologue document, a book, or a retranscription of famous spoken words
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Expository}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Subjective report: account of something the author has observed, heard, done, or investigated

\subsubsection{Speech}

\begin{itemize}

% \subsection{Annotation protocol}

% This is a proposed protocol for a future annotation task (work in progress).

% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item Sentences are identified (can be automated)
% 	\item 
% 		\begin{enumerate}
% 			\item Sentences are classified into speech acts (see \ref{sec:taxonomy})
% 			\item Speech acts dependencies are found
% 		\end{enumerate}
% 	\item 
% 		\begin{enumerate}
% 			\item Sentences that do not bear the same speech act as the previous one are marked as boundaries
% 			\item Further boundaries are inserted when, for two consecutive sentences bearing the same speech act:
% 				\begin{enumerate}
% 					\item Their speech acts are either Q-Q or OTHER
% 					\item Their speech acts are not both linked to the same sentence
% 				\end{enumerate}
% 		\end{enumerate}
% \end{enumerate}

% \subsection{Taxonomy}
% \label{sec:taxonomy}

% This taxonomy is a work in progress.\newline

% \textit{Question subclasses:} \\
% \textbf{Question-Question}: the sentence contains a new question. \\
% \textbf{Question-Add}: the sentence supplements a question by providing additional information, or asking a follow-up question. \\
% \textbf{Question-Problem}: the sentence introduces a question by stating a problem or one's motivations. \\
% \textbf{Question-Confirmation}: the sentence confirms details of the question or confirms that the same problem is being experienced by a non-initiator. \\
% \textbf{Question-Correction}: the sentence corrects errors in a question. \\
% \textbf{Question-Resolution}: the sentence confirms the question has been answered or rendered moot. \\

% \textit{Answer subclasses:} \\
% \textbf{Answer-Answer}: the sentence proposes an answer to a question. \\
% \textbf{Answer-Add}: the sentence supplements an answer by providing additional information. \\
% \textbf{Answer-Confirmation}: the sentence confirms details of the answer and/or that it should work. \\
% \textbf{Answer-Correction}: the sentence points out error(s) in an answer and/or corrects them. \\
% \textbf{Answer-Objection}: the sentence objects to an answer. \\
% \textbf{Answer-Acknowledgment}: the sentence acknowledges an answer without confirming or hindering it (by the question initiator only). \\

% \textit{Orphan classes:} \\
% \textbf{Ungrammatical}: the sentence is not grammatical (noise, punctuation, code, link, markup, ASCII art...). \\
% \textbf{Signature}: the sentence is part of the sender's signature block. \\
% \textbf{Civility}: the sentence is a polite mechanism that no other purpose. \\
% \textbf{Quote}: the sentence is quoted from a previous message
% \textbf{Other}: the sentence does not belong to any of the above classes. \\
