\subsection{Problem/Solution Classes}

The following taxonomy aims at capturing the way conversation participants introduce, explain and communicate about these problems and solutions.

The whole text doesn't have to be classified into these classes. Some sentences don't belong in any of them. 

\subsubsection{Primary Classes}

In online conversations bearing expressions of need and attempts at answering to those needs, we consider that sentences may bear information on two types of abstract objects

These two classes are mutually exclusive.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Problem
	\item Solution
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Secondary Classes}

These classes define the kind of information a sentence brings about a problem or a solution.
